# PyFibonacciTree
PyFibonacciTree is a Python script that generates a Fibonacci tree of a given depth and provides functionality to convert the tree structure into a nested list format.

## Fibonacci Tree

A Fibonacci tree is a recursive binary tree where each node's value is the Fibonacci number corresponding to its depth in the tree.

## Usage

### Generating Fibonacci Tree

To generate a Fibonacci tree, use the `fib_tree` function provided in the code. Example usage:

```python
from fibonacci_tree import fib_tree

fib = fib_tree(5)  # Generates a Fibonacci tree of depth 5
